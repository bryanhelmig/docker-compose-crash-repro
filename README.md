## Docker for Mac Native Crashing on Heavy IO

To reproduce https://github.com/docker/hyperkit/issues/50 which seems predicated on heavy IO through osxfs - follow this:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bryanhelmig/docker-compose-crash-repro.git
cd docker-compose-crash-repro
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f -t web
```

Now visit `http://localhost:8888/` and do some **shift-click-refresh**ing - after a few times I fairly reliably get this:

```

### Rebuilding Assets w/ More/Less Content

Default builds a dozen large JS files (3mb each), and 600 128px pngs, but you can tweak that to apply more/less pressure on IO:

```bash
vim make_files.py # change JS_COUNT, JS_BYTES_EACH, IMAGE_COUNT, IMAGE_PX_SIZE constants
rm -rf assets
docker-compose run web python make_files.py
# re-run docker-compose up -d, etc...
```
